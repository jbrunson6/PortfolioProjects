Here is a dashboard I made for my previous employment to track all financial transactions across all accounts.
Some of the information has been removed to ensure safety of information
You should only be able to change the month in J3 but please don't edit anything else if you have the oportunity.

Since we were in Mexico, we operated mostly in cash. However, the company we worked for is based in the US.
We used a combination of downloading bank statements  and tracking cash transactions with a ledger trying to get receipts for everything we could.
This was difficult at times because not everyone had receipts to give like if you were at a restaurant or tiendita. 
But we did the best we could with the situation at hand.
This helped us keep track of where our money was and how much USD we had at any point not just at the end of the month
